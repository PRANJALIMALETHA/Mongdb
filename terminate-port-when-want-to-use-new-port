Terminate the Process:

Run the following command to kill the process with PID 1792:

sh
Copy code
taskkill /PID 1792 /F
This command forces the process to terminate, freeing up port 8000.

Verify Port is Free:

Run netstat again to ensure that port 8000 is no longer in use:

sh
Copy code
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
If the port is free, the command should not show any results.
